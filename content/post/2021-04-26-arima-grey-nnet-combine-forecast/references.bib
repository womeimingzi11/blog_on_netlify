  abstract = {In statistics and econometrics, and in particular in time series analysis, an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is a generalization of an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model.  Both of these models are fitted to time series data either to better understand the data or to predict future points in the series (forecasting). ARIMA models are applied in some cases where data show evidence of non-stationarity in the sense of mean (but not variance/autocovariance), where an initial differencing step (corresponding to the "integrated" part of the model) can be applied one or more times to eliminate the non-stationarity of the mean function (i.e., the trend). When the seasonality shows in a time series, the seasonal-differencing could be applied to eliminate the seasonal component. Since the ARMA model, according to the Wold's decomposition theorem, is theoretically sufficient to describe a regular (a.k.a. purely nondeterministic) wide-sense stationary time series, we are motivated to make stationary a non-stationary time series, e.g., by using differencing, before we can use the ARMA model. Note that if the time series contains a predictable sub-process (a.k.a. pure sine or complex-valued exponential process), the predictable component is treated as a non-zero-mean but periodic (i.e., seasonal) component in the ARIMA framework so that it is eliminated by the seasonal differencing. The AR part of ARIMA indicates that the evolving variable of interest is regressed on its own lagged (i.e., prior) values. The MA part indicates that the regression error is actually a linear combination of error terms whose values occurred contemporaneously and at various times in the past. The I (for "integrated") indicates that the data values have been replaced with the difference between their values and the previous values (and this differencing process may have been performed more than once). The purpose of each of these features is to make the model fit the data as well as possible. Non-seasonal ARIMA models are generally denoted ARIMA(p,d,q) where parameters p, d, and q are non-negative integers, p is the order (number of time lags) of the autoregressive model, d is the degree of differencing (the number of times the data have had past values subtracted), and q is the order of the moving-average model. Seasonal ARIMA models are usually denoted ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)m, where m refers to the number of periods in each season, and the uppercase P,D,Q refer to the autoregressive, differencing, and moving average terms for the seasonal part of the ARIMA model.When two out of the three terms are zeros, the model may be referred to based on the non-zero parameter, dropping "AR", "I" or "MA" from the acronym describing the model. For example,                                    ARIMA                  (         1         ,         0         ,         0         )                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle \{\textbackslash text\{ARIMA\}\}(1,0,0)\}    is AR(1),                                    ARIMA                  (         0         ,         1         ,         0         )                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle \{\textbackslash text\{ARIMA\}\}(0,1,0)\}    is I(1), and                                    ARIMA                  (         0         ,         0         ,         1         )                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle \{\textbackslash text\{ARIMA\}\}(0,0,1)\}    is MA(1).

A Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model was applied to establish a highly predictive model of HFRS. Meteorological factors were considered external variables through a cross correlation analysis. Then, these factors were included in the SARIMA model to determine if they could improve the predictive ability of HFRS epidemics in the region. The optimal univariate SARIMA model was identified as (0,0,2)(1,1,1)12. The R2 of the prediction of HFRS cases from January 2014 to December 2014 was 0.857, and the Root mean square error (RMSE) was 2.708. However, the inclusion of meteorological variables as external regressors did not significantly improve the SARIMA model. This result is likely because seasonal variations in meteorological variables were included in the seasonal characteristics of the HFRS itself.},

  abstract = {Background Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health threat in China for China has a hepatitis B prevalence of more than one million people in 2017 year. Disease incidence prediction may help hepatitis B prevention and control. This study intends to build and compare 2 forecasting models for hepatitis B incidence in China. Methods Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and grey model GM(1,1) were adopted to fit the monthly incidence of hepatitis B in China from March 2010 to October 2017. The fitting and forecasting performances of the 2 models were evaluated. The better one was adopted to predict the incidence from November 2017 to March 2018. Database was built by Excel 2016 and statistical analysis was completed using R 3.4.3 software. Results Descriptive analysis showed that the incidence of hepatitis B in China has seasonal variation and has shown a downward trend from 2010 to 2017. We selected the ARIMA (3,1,1) (0,1,2)12 model among all the ARIMA models for it has the lowest AIC value. Model expression of GM (1,1) was X(1) (k + 1) = 3386876.7478e0.0249k − 3289206.7428. The root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of ARIMA(3,1,1)(0,1,2)12 model were lower than GM(1,1) model on fitting part and forecasting part. According to the forecast results, the incidence may have a slight fluctuation during the following months. Conclusions The ARIMA model showed better hepatitis B fitting and forecasting performance than GM(1,1) model. It is a potential decision supportive tool for controlling hepatitis B in China before a predictive hepatitis B outbreak.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis is a major global public health problem, which also affects economic and social development. China has the second largest burden of tuberculosis in the world. The tuberculosis morbidity in Xinjiang is much higher than the national situation; therefore, there is an urgent need for monitoring and predicting tuberculosis morbidity so as to make the control of tuberculosis more effective. Recently, the Box-Jenkins approach, specifically the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, is typically applied to predict the morbidity of infectious diseases; it can take into account changing trends, periodic changes, and random disturbances in time series. Autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) models are the prevalent tools used to deal with time series heteroscedasticity. In this study, based on the data of the tuberculosis morbidity from January 2004 to June 2014 in Xinjiang, we establish the single ARIMA (1, 1, 2) (1, 1, 1)12 model and the combined ARIMA (1, 1, 2) (1, 1, 1)12-ARCH (1) model, which can be used to predict the tuberculosis morbidity successfully in Xinjiang. Comparative analyses show that the combined model is more effective. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to establish the ARIMA model and ARIMA-ARCH model for prediction and monitoring the monthly morbidity of tuberculosis in Xinjiang. Based on the results of this study, the ARIMA (1, 1, 2) (1, 1, 1)12-ARCH (1) model is suggested to give tuberculosis surveillance by providing estimates on tuberculosis morbidity trends in Xinjiang, China.},

  abstract = {Grey theory is one approach that can be used to construct a model with limited samples to provide better forecasting advantage for short-term problems. Generally, the GM (1,1) and Discrete GM (1,1) models are two typical grey forecasting models in grey theory. However, there are two shortcomings in the above grey models respectively, i.e., the homogeneous-exponent simulative deviation in GM (1,1) model, and the unequal conversion between the original and white equations in DGM (1,1) model. In this paper, we firstly propose a novel Generalized GM (1,1) model termed GGM (1,1) model, based on GM (1,1) and DGM (1,1) models, to overcome the above shortcomings. Then, we detailedly study four important properties in this new grey model. Four estimative approaches of stepwise ratio in GGM (1,1) model context is also covered. In the end, we simulate and forecast the fuel production in China during the period 2003–2010 using three GM (1,1) models. The empirical results show that GGM (1,1) model has higher simulative and predictive accuracy than GM (1,1) and DGM (1,1) models. This work contributes significantly to improve grey forecasting theory and proposes a optimized GM (1,1) model.},
